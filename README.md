# Odin Recipes

This is a simple HTML project completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal was to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## What I Built

The project consists of:
- An `index.html` homepage that links to three individual recipe pages.
- Each recipe page is its own HTML file and includes:
  - A recipe title
  - An image of the dish
  - A link to return to the homepage
  - A list of ingredients (unordered list)
  - A set of instructions (ordered list)

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned how to:
- Create and structure a multi-page HTML website
- Use anchor tags (`<a>`) to link between files in different directories
- Insert and resize images while maintaining aspect ratio
- Organize content using headings, paragraphs, and HTML lists (both ordered and unordered)

This project helped me build a strong foundation in basic HTML and page linking. It also taught me how to make pages more readable and visually organized using simple layout techniques.
